Social Feature Roadmap 1/28/2018

* User story
    * As a user, I want to be able to invite other users to meals (lunch, dinner, etc.) from the app.
    * For example, I can pick business(es), select friends to invite, and they will receive a notification where they can respond, or perhaps suggest a different place.
    * Users can suggest a single business, or create a poll to let other users and themself vote
    * This functionality should be available either in the main app (Android/iOS) or in an Android Instant App, and email notifications for users that don't have the app.
