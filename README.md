Can't decide what to eat? Let us help you!

#### Background

No matter how many stars a restaurant has on Yelp, you'll get sick of it if you eat there everyday.  Fork Authority let's you specify things like "just ate here", "like", or "don't like".  The app will store your preferences and provide you with a personalized list of search results.  You can also "swipe to dismiss" to help narrow down your options.

#### How It Works

Provides a list of nearby restaurants for you to choose from (powered by Yelp)

"Liking" a restaurant moves it to the top of the list

"Don't like" removes it
 
"Just ate here" removes it for a couple days

Swipe cards away to help narrow down options

Click the Refresh button to start over

Fork Authority will remember your preferences for next time
